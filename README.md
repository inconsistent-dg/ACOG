Animal Crossing: Old Groove (name subject to change). Bringing "Special" villagers from AFe+ and Welcome Amiibo to NH.

Idea taken from the [Animal Crossing Fandom](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Special_villagers). What makes the villagers special is that they were not in the American localized Animal Crossing [AFe+], or required a physical item to get [NLWA].

Thanks to collaborators of the [Animal Crossing HD texture pack](https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-animal-crossing-hd-texture-pack-version-16-january-26th-2022) for allowing me to use their textures. They generously let me use the redrawn versions of Bow, Meow, Nindori, Pierre, Shinabiru, and Shoukichi. While most had to be slightly edited to fit the new UV map of NH, the original art is their own. All other textures made by me.

If you want to download the current *unfinished* version of the mod, clone the repository and drag the atmosphere folder to the root of your SD card. I might change the default clothes they wear as well, down the line. Just to make them more representative of their original selves.
